## Introduction 🚀

**Reprebot** uses a method called Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). This technique involves utilizing a Language Model (LLM) to generate text using a specific context of information stored in a vector database. In this case, the context revolves around information related to the academic processes within the Faculty of Engineering.

## Scope 🔭

**Reprebot** will initially be a microservice containerized and ready to be incorporated in any architecture. In the future we may implement a user-friendly interface so that the community can access it in the web at any time. Or it may be integrated in any of the other systems of the Faculty of Engineering.

## Purpose 🎯

**Reprebot** has the following main objectives:

- **Quick Help:** Provide fast responses to the Faculty of Engineering community whenever they need assistance, eliminating the need for emails or visiting various departments.

- **Student Support:** Assist students throughout their academic journey by offering information on processes, events, and career opportunities.

- **Reduce Workload:** Ease the workload of **Repreisis** and other dependencies within the Faculty of Engineering, enabling them to concentrate on more impactful tasks and better address student needs.
